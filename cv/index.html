<h3>THESIS AND ACADEMIC PROJECTS___________________________________________</h3>

<h4>Title: Comparative study between Selection Mapping Technique (SLM) and Clipping & Filtering Technique (CAF) for  PAPR reduction in OFDM signals:</h4>

A multicarrier transmission technique known as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is very attractive for high-speed transmission over wireless communication. OFDM has a serious drawback called high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) problem. To reduce the PAPR, many techniques have been proposed, such as clipping, coding, partial transmit sequence (PTS), selected mapping (SLM), interleaving, hadamard transforms and other techniques. This paper is focused in the domain of Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) reduction in OFDM system using Comparative study between Selection Mapping Technique (SLM) and Clipping & Filtering Technique (CAF).
